# Welcome to Cards Against How Might We (CaHMW)

This game was created to help people practice the art of forming how might we questions (HMWs) as a response to common blockers. There is no way to “win or lose” at this game, but rather to help a group learn together and practice.

## Who Should Play CaHMW? 
Often in large organizations we experience blockers that a ‘How Might We?’ (HMW) question could unlock. It’s our hypothesis that teaching and practicing this skill to everyone could help empower people in their own organizations to help create the conditions for change. It is a great activity in the context of other group sessions focused on change or innovation.
